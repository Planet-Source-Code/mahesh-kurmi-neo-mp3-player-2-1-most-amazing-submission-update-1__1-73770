    and database file

5.  library supports playcount feature (keeps account of no of times file is played) which i like a lot


BUGS and SUGGESTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Bug:  If it shows error : Unable to set up corporate level with hardware

   Solution:      Make sure you run the application as administraor in vista/windows 7 because it registers ausio engine
         and subclasses controls  and its window.
         Right click on exe, then click on run as administrator

2. Bug:  Window goes outside the screen or any other problem related to loss of default settings
   Solution: Reset the plaver :
         ight click on player window>>> option>>>reset player

3. Bug:  Skin is not loading properly 
   Solution: Not all the skins are completely done, for best experience use DEFAULT skin or winamp skin

4. File asssociaion: It doest work thoroughly when winamp is installed.
   Soultion: Just disable winamp agent to get it working or set openwith ...default.
    

4. Other bugs:
   pls let me know. I want my player to be perfect handy bug free and opensource
   If you are interested in programming and find yourself to be keen in learning and contributing in player pls contact me
   i will be very happy in making u a part of it.

5. Suggestions:
   The most important part :  PLZ make me aware of amendments in this music player, what you want more it to do, and the way to make it more
   user friendly. But Pls dont ask me to impement capability of playing video files I will be making separate player for this.
   it is purely a music player.


I am planning to submit the whole code on net as soon as i complete this but i want all the member to support me by notifying me the bugs and extra features to be implemented and more importantly 
Suggestions for better performance.
I have included screenshot for my Mp3player.


Thanks to all testers downloaders and my wellwishers:
