### Description

NeoPlayer: Perhaps the best Submission on PSC so far.

Update: code is properly aligned, skin fixes, performance tweaks, more comments are added and many more..

Please comment about its performance bugs and suggestions, help keeping VB alive.

Description:

It handles the playing chores for MP3,Ogg, WAV, MIDI, CD Audio, It looks and sounds great, it's lightweight and powerful, and it manages your media in hard drive in a fantastic way by its easy to use media library. It has all features that a professional mediaplayer like winamp (Skin, equalizer, DFX, Library, Visualisation, Tag editing etc.) should have.

I am sharing my mp3Player Project with all u great developers. I am working on

it since last 3-4 years(as my hobby). I have learnt a lot from PSC and I hope this project will be helping many. Atleast it will show the strength of VB.

I am waiting for all suggestions and bugs found so that i can make it better one.

Use the link below to download fully working project with all compatibility files available

(incase PSC deletes some)
